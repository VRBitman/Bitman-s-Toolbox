# Bitman's Toolbox
_A PowerShell-based swiss army knife for the do-all sysadmin!_

**Bitman's Toolbox**, a powerful script-based collection of management tools, is a graphical user interface written in PowerShell which allows an administrator to manage Active Directory, Microsoft Exchange, VMware vSphere and various other infrastructure services through a series of command-line tools that can be executed directly from said graphical interface.
